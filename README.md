## Dataset 

To access the dataset, unzip the dataset.zip file. This contains the dataset, few-shot examples and responses collected from GPT models along with extracted answers. 
The dataset contains questions from Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics collected from JEE Advanced 2016 to 2023. The breakdown with respect to subject type and response type is as follows:

## Quick example

To run a baseline such as GPT-3.5 with zero-shot Chain of Thought on the first 10 questions of the dataset using 2 parallel requests, run:
`python inference.py --model gpt-3.5-turbo --mode CoT --max_questions 1 --num_procs 2`

To evaluate your results, use the code provided in compute_metrics.py:
`python compute_metrics.py`
